# Data_Science 1 

- This Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks,.
- i will be working on titanic sruvival prediction using all the diffrent model /tools 

<b>Note:</b> Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

<b> <u>Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally  </u> </b>

 -Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
 -Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc,
 
 - <b>Note:</b> i used Google colab to excute the code.

 ### Machine Learning:
  - Supervised and unsupervised learning : Testing out several different learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger will survive or not the titanc crach based on prevuios data .
  - <b>Tools:</b> scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, RL , LL , DT, RF,....
 ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
  -  Using diffrent technique to study the relationship betwenn all the variable , Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas,matplot lib and Seaborn visualisations , also scaling and creating new feauters.
  -  <b>Tools:</b> Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib
